                    Welcome,
                    <br>
                    My name is Daniel J. Sykes. I am a 31 year old Veteran, a father to a beautiful little 7 year old and a brother of two younger siblings.
                    I have am looking to make a career change from Physical Therapy to Full Stack Web Dev. I was scrolling on youtube,
                    came across a video of a day in the life of a Junior devoloper and from the information contained in the video I found 
                    a few sites to get started for free. I wasn't majorly impressed with the presentation of information so I thought it would be a 
                    good idea to try out a bootcamp.
                    <br>
                    <p>
                    I look forward to creating and refactoring many different project. The creativity aspect of the job is what really grabs my attention.
                    I am currently in the bootcamp and have made a few friends along the way. Everyone in the class is great and my instructor is very knowledagble
                    and has a really unique teaching style that accomadates everyone aboard our journey. I look forward to the challenge of the bootcamp and the chance to put what I
                    learn into action. Thanks for spending your time reading this! 
                    </p>
